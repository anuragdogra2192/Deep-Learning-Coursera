## Coursera, deeplearning.ai

### Course 1- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* Studied the major technology trends driving Deep Learning and the key parameters in a neural network’s architecture.
* Built, trained and applied fully connected deep neural networks using Python3, NumPy, SciPy etc. 
* Improved the efficiency of neural networks by vectorization.

### Course 2- Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* Studied and effectively used the common neural network “tricks and techniques”, including parameter initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking.
* Implemented and applied a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam to check for their convergence. 
* Understood the new best-practices for the DL era to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias and variance. 
* Implemented a neural network using TensorFlow.

### Course 3- Convolutional Neural Networks -currently pursuing
